MBA CANDIDATE • CONTENT CREATOR • DYNAMIC LEADER • BUSINESS DEVELOPER • SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETER

I`ve always taken life as a journey from one experience to another. So far it has been a road full of interesting events and people. Full of love and happiness and also there has been lots of letting go of events, places, and people. I`ve never stopped creating new life events because in my eyes life is a pure act of creation full of opportunities that arise from every new moment.
