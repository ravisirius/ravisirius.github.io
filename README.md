I've always taken life as a journey from one experience to another. So far, it has been a road full of interesting events anfd people. Full of love and happiness and also there has been lots of letting go events, places and people.
I've never stopped creating new life events because in my eyes life is a pure act of creation full of opportunities that aries from every new moment.
